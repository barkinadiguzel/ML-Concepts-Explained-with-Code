# ðŸ§© ML & DL Concepts Explained with Code

This repository is a collection of **hands-on examples for confusing machine learning and deep learning concepts**.  
Each folder/file focuses on a single concept, with a **brief explanation** and a **minimal PyTorch implementation**, often accompanied by visualizations.  

ðŸ“Œ **Purpose:**  
- Understand core ML/DL concepts (embedding, attention, loss functions, optimizers, etc.) through simple examples.  
- See the concepts in action, not just read about them.  
- Showcase in a portfolio that you **experimented and implemented these concepts yourself**.
